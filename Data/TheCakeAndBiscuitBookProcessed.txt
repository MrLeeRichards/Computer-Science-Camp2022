    The Cake and Biscuit Book   By Elizabeth Douglas  [Illustration]   London Grant Richards 48 Leicester Square 1903     Preface   The recipes in this book are English, French, Portuguese and Dutch; while some of the best come from America, which is the true land of cakes
All are good: the best I have starred
 Amateur cooks should know that for cakes to be successful it is almost imperative that they are made and baked by the same person
Delegation too often means ruin, the bond of sympathy between maker and baker being only in very rare instances sufficiently close to defeat the imp of mischief that lurks in every oven
 Lastly, I might say that the eggs cannot be too fresh, nor the butter too pure; and molasses is better than treacle

 Several sets of tins are necessary if cake is to be made often
One or two ordinary round tins, a tin with a hollow tube in the centre, square tins, and shallow round tins about 8 inches in diameter for jam sandwich and layer cakes, should be kept
A small dripping-pan is very good to bake gingerbread in, and for very light cakes the German tin with a loose bottom should be used
These tins are excellent, for the bottom can be pushed up, away from the sides, and there is no danger of the cake being broken in taking it out of the tin
They can be bought at Harrod’s Stores, Brompton Road
  _Measuring._--Flour, sugar, salt, ground spices, soda, must always be sifted before measuring
This is of the utmost importance in making good cakes
 A cup is a breakfast-cup holding half a pint
The spoons are the silver ones in general use
 A spoonful of dry material is one in which the convexity at the top corresponds to the concavity of the spoon
A scant spoonful should be made level with the edges of the spoon
 In measuring half a tea-spoon of dry material, fill it first, and then divide it with a knife long-ways down the spoon
 A “heaping cupful” is a cup filled as full as it will hold
A “cupful” should be levelled
A “scant cupful” should not be filled above about quarter of an inch from the top
 It is necessary to remember in measuring half or quarter cups that a cup is smaller at the bottom than the top
It is more satisfactory measuring to have half-pint measures marked into quarters
  _Table of Measures_  4 cups flour = 1 quart or 1 lb
2 cups of butter (solid) = 1 lb
2¹⁄₂ cups powdered sugar = 1 lb
1 cup = ¹⁄₂ pint 1 glass = ¹⁄₂ pint 1 pint milk or water = 1 lb
9 large eggs = 1 lb
1 table-spoon butter = 1 oz
1 heaping table-spoon butter = 2 ozs
Butter the size of an egg = 2 ozs
  _Baking Powder._--Baking powder can be used in the making of most cakes
In some however the proportion of carbonate of soda and cream of tartar of which it consists is not right, in which case the two ingredients should be used separately according to the directions
Almost invariably soda should be mixed with milk or water, which should then be strained in order to keep back any dregs
Cream of tartar should be mixed with the flour, which should then be sifted
Both cream of tartar and soda should be pulverized before they are measured or used
 Baking powder can be bought, or made as follows:--  1 part carbonate of soda 2 parts cream of tartar  It should be kept in an air-tight tin
 In nearly all cases baking powder is best mixed with the flour, which should then be sifted through a fine sieve
  _To clean currants._--Sprinkle the currants with flour, put them on a coarse sieve and rub them until the stems and grit are separated and go through the sieve
Then wash thoroughly in water, changing it until clear
Drain on a towel and pick over
Dry, if the weather permits, in the _sun_, not in an oven
  _To stone raisins._--Pour boiling water over the raisins, and let them stand in it for ten minutes
Drain and rub each raisin between finger and thumb till the seeds come out
Cut open or chop
  _Sultanas._--Pick over sultanas carefully, removing the little stems
  _To blanch almonds._--Put the almonds into boiling water and let them soak in it until the skins rub off easily between the finger and thumb
Drain and spread out to dry
  _To pound almonds._--After blanching let them soak for an hour in cold water, then pound in a good sized mortar until reduced to a soft pulp
Whilst pounding add a few drops of orange-flower water or lemon juice
  _Mixing._--There are three ways of mixing
Stirring, Beating, Cutting (or Folding)
  _To stir._--Let the spoon touch the bottom and sides of the basin and move it round quickly in circles of various sizes
Do not lift it out of the mixture, and work well against the sides
  _To beat._--Tip the bowl to one side
Bring the spoon or fork quickly down into the mixture and through it, take it out the other side and bring it over and down again, scraping the sides well each time it goes in
 It is important to keep the bowl of the spoon well scraped out during mixing
 Beat quickly and hard
  _To cut or fold._--Turn over the mixture with a spoon and lift it up, folding in the white of egg as lightly as possible
Do not stir or beat but mix very gently until quite blended
  _To beat eggs._--It is generally best to beat the yolks and whites separately
For beating them there is nothing better than a Dover egg beater, although a fork can be used for the yolks and a steel knife for the whites
 Beat the yolks in a bowl until they thicken and become light and creamy
 Beat the whites on a platter until they are stiff and absolutely dry
  _To beat butter._--In beating butter to a cream, if very hard it can be slightly warmed in the oven or put into a hot bowl, but it must on no account be melted
It should just be softened in order to make it more easy to beat it
  _To grease and fill tins._--Tins can be greased with _fresh_ butter, lard or sweet oil
Sides and bottom should be evenly but not thickly smeared with grease
 When a tin is to be lined with paper, cut a piece to fit the bottom exactly, another piece to go right round the sides
This piece should project two or three inches above the top of the tin
 Grease the papers thoroughly before putting them in the tin
 Fill the tins two-thirds full, leaving a very slight depression in the centre if a flat cake is wanted, as the tendency is to rise in the middle
  _The oven._--Nearly all cakes should be baked in a moderate oven, and the fire should be so made up before putting a cake in the oven, that it will not have to be touched again until the cake is taken out
If this is impossible, owing to the length of time it takes, add a little coal frequently to the fire instead of letting it down and making it up with a great deal of fuel
 In baking in a gas stove, it is important that there should be no draughts from window or door
 Set the cake in the middle of the oven and do not move it until it has risen its full height, which will take about half the time in which it is baked
For the first quarter of an hour it is not necessary to look at the cake unless there is a fear that the oven is too hot
Afterwards do so occasionally, opening and shutting the oven door very gently and never taking the cake out
After it has fully risen, the cake can be turned round if it is baking quicker on one side than the other
 Do not have anything else in the oven while baking a cake
 For layer cakes and thin cakes make up a larger fire
They should bake quickly
 To test whether a cake is done, put a clean straw or skewer into the thickest part of it
If it comes out clean the cake is done
  _To remove cakes from tins._--With a few exceptions cakes should be taken out of their tins directly they come out of the oven
Turn the tin upside down, and, if necessary, loosen the sides with a knife
Set on a sieve to cool
  To all cake mixtures add a little salt, sifting it with the flour in the proportion of a small salt-spoon of salt to every half-pint of flour
 Keep flour and sugar in a dry place, or dry thoroughly before using

  Plain Icing  Whites of 2 eggs ¹⁄₂ lb
_icing_ sugar Flavouring, lemon, vanilla, or almond, etc
 Break the whites into a good sized dish
Add two heaping table-spoons of sugar and stir it in steadily
Beat for a few minutes
Add the sugar gradually, beating well
The making should take about half-an-hour
When thick enough it should not run together again after being cut with a knife
If flavoured with lemon juice, a little more sugar should be added or the icing will not be stiff enough
 Pour the icing on to the cake by large spoonfuls and allow it to settle itself as much as possible
When using a knife, dip it first in cold water
 Ice a cake two or three hours before it is to be eaten
It can be set to harden in a moderate oven for five minutes if needed quickly: but it is best to dry it slowly in a warm, sunny place
  Boiled Icing  1 cup powdered sugar 1 cup water Whites of two eggs Flavouring  Boil the sugar and water together until it spins a thread from a spoon
Then take the syrup off the fire and pour it into a basin
Add the whites (beaten to a stiff froth) to it gradually, beating hard all the time

of chocolate
Add it to the plain icing (see page 65)
Flavour with a few drops of vanilla

Cover it with four tea-spoons orange juice
Let it soak for half-an-hour
Squeeze the juice through a fine cloth

65)

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment
Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS
 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance
To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate
 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States
U.S
laws alone swamp our small staff
 Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  Professor Michael S
Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone
For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S
unless a copyright notice is included
Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
 Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
